# LinkedIn Job Automation Using Python (Selenium)

This code will allow you to automatically apply to your chosen LinkedIn jobs. The overall code runs best if Job settings/filters include 1-click apply option. 
However, due to the countless variations in LinkedIn's '1-Click Apply', the code will only work on specific 1-Click Apply applications while closing all the 
others that do not fit/follow the specific flow of the code.
